*Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

I was tasked to develop software for The Gaming Room, a client who needed a web-based application for their mobile game titled "Draw it or Lose It." They needed the application to use the same features as the mobile app, as well as utilize cross play between multiple different platforms.

*What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The thing I believe I did particularly well was conveying my ideas in a consistant, organized, and easy-to-understand manner.

*What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document taught me that all aspects of devenoping a program need to be considered, even ones I never paid much attention to before. Things such as memory and storage management, as well as limitaations of certain operating systems come to mind for things I would have normally taken for granted.

*If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think I need more work on recommending certain operating platforms based on the client's needs. I did the best I could with the information I understood, but I feel like I could have elaborated more or taken certain limitations into account.

*How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's need for cross-platform play was taken into account for my recommendation of a cloud-based server platform. Considering the user's needs is immensely important because if not paid attention to, the program could wind up drastically different than the client anticipated. This could be disasterous and would most likely lead to the program needing to be entirely reworked.

*How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approched designing software in a ver matter-of-fact style. The user's needs must be considered, and I shouldn't be too concerned for what I personally think is important in a program. This assignment helped me consider all the options, and not to take a program at face value.
